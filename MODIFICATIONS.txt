**Date of Modifications:** 2025-07-24

**Modifier:** [Nghi Tran / ClickMedix]

**Purpose of Modifications:**
To enhance thread safety and prevent `RuntimeError: Set changed size during iteration` exceptions in concurrent web application environments, specifically when using Storm's event system with multiple simultaneous requests or background operations.

**Affected Files and Specific Changes:**

1.  **File: `storm/event.py`**

    * **Class:** `EventSystem`

    * **Changes:**
        * **Added `import threading`** at the top of the file.
        * **Added a reentrant lock (`threading.RLock()`)** as `self._lock` to the `__init__` method of the `EventSystem` class.
        * **Modified `hook(self, name, callback, *data)` method:**
            * Wrapped the entire method's logic within `with self._lock:`, ensuring atomic addition of callbacks to `self._hooks`.
        * **Modified `unhook(self, name, callback, *data)` method:**
            * Wrapped the entire method's logic within `with self._lock:`, ensuring atomic removal of callbacks from `self._hooks`.
            * Added logic to `del self._hooks[name]` if the callback set becomes empty.
        * **Modified `emit(self, name, *args)` method:**
            * Wrapped the initial snapshot creation (`callbacks_to_execute = list(callbacks)`) within `with self._lock:`, to ensure a consistent copy of callbacks.
            * Implemented a `callbacks_to_remove` list to collect callbacks returning `False`.
            * Added a final block `if callbacks_to_remove:` that re-acquires `with self._lock:` and then iterates through `callbacks_to_remove` calling `self.unhook()` for each, ensuring thread-safe removal of callbacks after the emission cycle.
            * Added `try...except` block around `callback(owner, *(args + data))` to log exceptions without halting event emission.
